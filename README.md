## Overview

Cordova SyncKit Android Plugin is an implementation of the SyncKit API for Android. The SyncKit API is a client library that TV or Companion Screen web apps use to synchronise their media objects to an external timeline source. 

This API library implementations  support **interdevice synchronisation** via the DVB-CSS suite of protocols.

The documentation for this API is available in the [README](https://gitlab-ext.irt.de/2-immerse/synckit/tree/master/api) file in the ```/api``` .
